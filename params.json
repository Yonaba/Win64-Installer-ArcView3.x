Unless you proceed manually to some hacky\r\n(and dirty) things.\r\n\r\nThe following script generates a Windows x64 (64-bits) compatible setup \r\nexecutable from a Windows x86 (32-bits) installation of ArcView. It just means that you will have to find a PC running Windows 32-bits where the official *ArcView 3.2a* is \r\nproperly installed, and run this script using [Inno Setup](http://www.jrsoftware.org/).\r\n\r\nIt will build a 64-bits executable that you can use to install ArcView on any supported x64 based edition of Windows.<br>\r\nFind the generated executable in the [build](http://github.com/Yonaba/Win64-Installer-ArcView3.x/blob/master/build) folder.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Note**: *ArcView installs its file in the folder `C:\\ESRI`, by default. You should ensure that this location is valid before running this script. In case it is not, please [update the script](http://github.com/Yonaba/Win64-Installer-ArcView3.x/blob/master/script.iss#L47) before using it.*\r\n\r\n##License\r\n*ESRI ArcView* is a proprietary software.\r\n\r\n> Copyright (c) 1999 Environmental Systems Research Institute,\r\n> Inc.
